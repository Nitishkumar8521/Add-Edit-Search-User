QUESTION 1:- 
if (query.length > 0) {
      const filtered = users.filter(user => user.email.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase()));
      setSuggestions(filtered.map(user => ({ email: user.email, fullName: ${user.firstName} ${user.lastName} })));
      setFilteredUsers(filtered);
    } else {
      setSuggestions([]);
      setFilteredUsers(users);
    }

explain this portion because in if condition filteredUsers and suggestions contain the same number of elements but in else condition filteredUsers contain element and suggestion is empty array. Why?

Great question! Let's break down this part of the code to understand what's happening in both the if and else conditions.

Code Explanation
javascript
Copy code
if (query.length > 0) {
  const filtered = users.filter(user => user.email.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase()));
  setSuggestions(filtered.map(user => ({ email: user.email, fullName: `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}` })));
  setFilteredUsers(filtered);
} else {
  setSuggestions([]);
  setFilteredUsers(users);
}
Understanding the Logic
1. if (query.length > 0) Condition:
This condition checks whether the search query (the text entered by the user in the search input) is not empty (i.e., its length is greater than 0).

Filtering Users:

javascript
Copy code
const filtered = users.filter(user => user.email.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase()));
users.filter(...): This filters the users array to include only those users whose email contains the search query.
user.email.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase()): This checks if the user's email contains the search query, in a case-insensitive manner.
As a result, filtered is an array containing all users whose email matches the search query.

Updating suggestions:

javascript
Copy code
setSuggestions(filtered.map(user => ({ email: user.email, fullName: `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}` })));
This creates a list of suggestions for the autocomplete feature. Each suggestion includes the user's email and full name.
filtered.map(...): The map function transforms each filtered user into an object containing their email and full name.
Updating filteredUsers:

javascript
Copy code
setFilteredUsers(filtered);
This updates the filteredUsers state with the list of users that match the search query.
In summary, when the search query is not empty, filteredUsers and suggestions are both populated with the same set of users, but suggestions is a transformed version specifically for autocomplete, containing only the email and full name.

2. else Condition:
This condition runs when the search query is empty (i.e., the user has cleared the search input).

Clearing suggestions:

javascript
Copy code
setSuggestions([]);
The suggestions array is set to an empty array because there is no search query, so there are no autocomplete suggestions to display.
Resetting filteredUsers:

javascript
Copy code
setFilteredUsers(users);
The filteredUsers array is reset to the original users array, meaning all users are displayed in the list.
Why is suggestions empty in the else condition?
In the else block, the search query is empty, so there's no need for autocomplete suggestions. Autocomplete suggestions only make sense when the user is typing something in the search bar. Therefore, suggestions is set to an empty array to clear any previously shown suggestions.

On the other hand, filteredUsers is reset to show all users because when there's no search query, the full list of users should be displayed.
